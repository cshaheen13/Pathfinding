# [WIP] Pathfinding Grid and Procedural Maze Generation in Unreal Engine 4
> An Unreal Engine 4 application that can procedurally generate a maze and simulate pathfinding on a grid utilizing Dijkstra's Algorithm. 

> Gold = Start | Hex = End | Black = Wall | White = Visited Blocks for Pathfinding | Blue = Unvisited Blocks for Pathfinding  | Red = Shortest Path

> Maze generation is procedural, based on recursive backtracking.

## To-Do
- Update material change delay to better visualize the algorithm
- Implement additional algorithms, such as A* and weighted Dijkstras
- Include visual keybinds 
- M = Generate Maze | Q = Set Start Point | E = Set End Point | Left Click = Set Wall | Right Click = Reset Block

## Installation
- Clone this repo to your local machine using https://github.com/cshaheen13/Pathfinding
- Requires Unreal Engine 4
